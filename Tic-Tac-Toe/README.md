# Tic Tac Toe   

This is a simple **Tic Tac Toe game** I built while learning Python with *Automate the Boring Stuff*.  

## Features
- Play against a basic NPC (it can block and try to win)  
- Input validation with `pyinputplus`  
- Win/tie detection on a 3x3 board (game support other sizes of the board) 
- Randomized turn order  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/e1mir1/PublicRepo.git
   cd PublicRepo```

2. Install pyinputplus:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinputplus```

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python ticTacToe.py```

## Notes
- First bigger Python project Iâ€™ve made.
- Written in a procedural style (no OOP yet).
- Built as part of my progress learning from Automate the Boring Stuff.
